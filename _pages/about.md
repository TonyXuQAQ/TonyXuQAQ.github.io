Hello, this is Zhenhua Xu(许振华), a 4-th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I am co-supervised by [Prof.Ming Liu](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=ming-liu-eelium) and [Prof.Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/). Before joining HKUST, I received my bachelor degree in Ectronics and Information Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research insterests lie in high-definition map automatic annotation, Imitation learing, line-shaped object detection, aerial image understanding, etc. 

Currently, I aim to apply deep learning approaches and robotics techniques to automatically create vector maps (e.g., road network map and high-definition map) for autonomous driving system. The key task is detecting the graph of target objects (e.g., road, road boundary, lane centerline, etc) from input images or image sequences.
