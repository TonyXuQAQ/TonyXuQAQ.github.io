Hello, this is Zhenhua Xu(许振华). Currently I work as a postdoc in the University of Hong Kong (HKU) with [Prof. Hengshuang Zhao](https://hszhao.github.io/).

I received my Ph.D. from the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I was co-supervised by [Prof.Ming Liu](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=ming-liu-eelium) and [Prof.Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/). Prior to joining HKUST, I obtained my bachelor degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Prof. Yun Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yun-Zhang-72).

My research insterests widely lie in high-definition map automatic generation, image-to-graph detection, computer vision, imitation learing, autonomous driving, robotics, GIS, aerial image understanding, etc. Specifically, I aim to apply computer vision approaches and robotics techniques to automatically generate vector maps (e.g., standard-definition map and high-definition map) for autonomous driving systems. The key task is detecting the graph of target objects (e.g., road, road boundary, lane centerline, etc) from input images or data sequences.

Drop me an email if you are interested in these topics. Collaborations in any forms are welcomed!
