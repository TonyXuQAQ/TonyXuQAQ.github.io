Hello, this is Zhenhua Xu(许振华). Currently I work as a postdoc in the School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Jianqiang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5mUoFN0AAAAJ&hl=en).

Previously, I spent a wonderful year in the University of Hong Kong (HKU) with [Prof. Hengshuang Zhao](https://hszhao.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. from the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I was co-supervised by [Prof.Ming Liu](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=ming-liu-eelium) and [Prof.Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/). Prior to joining HKUST, I obtained my bachelor degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Prof. Yun Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yun-Zhang-72).

My primary research interests encompass a broad range of topics, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, multimodal language models, end-to-end vehicle planning, high-definition mapping, GIS imitation learning, and more. My specific focus is on the application of computer vision and robotics techniques to develop robust and dependable autonomous driving systems and agents that seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. The core challenges lie in empowering AI agents to accurately comprehend their surroundings and make well-informed decisions accordingly.

<!-- My research insterests widely lie in high-definition map automatic generation, image-to-graph detection, computer vision, imitation learing, autonomous driving, robotics, GIS, aerial image understanding, etc. Specifically, I aim to apply computer vision approaches and robotics techniques to automatically generate vector maps (e.g., standard-definition map and high-definition map) for autonomous driving systems. The key task is detecting the graph of target objects (e.g., road, road boundary, lane centerline, etc) from input images or data sequences. -->

Drop me an email if you are interested in these topics. Collaborations in any forms are welcomed!
