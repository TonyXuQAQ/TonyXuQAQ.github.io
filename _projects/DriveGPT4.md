        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
In the past decade, autonomous driving has experienced rapid development in both academia and industry. However, its limited interpretability remains a significant unsolved problem, severely hindering autonomous vehicle commercialization and further development. Previous approaches utilizing small language models have failed to address this issue due to their lack of flexibility, generalization ability, and robustness. Recently, multimodal large language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention from the research community for their capability to process and reason non-text data (e.g., images and videos) by text. 
 In this paper, we present DriveGPT4, an interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving system utilizing LLMs. DriveGPT4 is capable of interpreting vehicle actions and providing corresponding reasoning, as well as answering diverse questions posed by human users for enhanced interaction. Additionally, DriveGPT4 predicts vehicle low-level control signals in an end-to-end fashion. These capabilities stem from a customized visual instruction tuning dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving.  To the best of our knowledge, DriveGPT4 is the first work focusing on interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.  When evaluated on multiple tasks alongside conventional methods and video understanding LLMs, DriveGPT4 demonstrates superior qualitative and quantitative performance. Additionally, DriveGPT4 can be generalized in a zero-shot fashion to accommodate more unseen scenarios.
